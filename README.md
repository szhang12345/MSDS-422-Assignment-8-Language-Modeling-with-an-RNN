# Management Problem
Suppose management is thinking about using a language model to classify written customer reviews and call and complaint logs. If the most critical customer messages can be identified, then customer support personnel can be assigned to contact those customers.

How would you advise senior management? What kinds of systems and methods would be most relevant to the customer services function? Considering the results of this assignment in particular, what is needed to make an automated customer support system that is capable of identifying negative customer feelings? What can data scientists do to make language models more useful in a customer service function?

# Solution Overview
Establishing an effective and efficient customer management system by building a language model that is capable of identifying negative customer feelings
Utilize RNN within Python for negative and positive comments identification.
The steps for the analysis are the following:
1.	Revise the jump-start code to accommodate two pre-trained word vectors and two vocabulary sizes. 
2.	Build four distinct language models by twisting the RNN structures or hyperparameter settings.
3.	Evaluate four language models using classification accuracy in the test set.
